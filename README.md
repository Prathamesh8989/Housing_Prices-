# Housing_Prices

The project files are already arranged in a well-ordered sequence. Most of the code outputs have been saved, so if you're running this on a local machine, please make sure to either delete the saved outputs or rename the output files in the code to avoid any conflicts.

You’ve been provided with a single archive: everything.rar. Here’s how to proceed:

Extract everything.rar – Inside, you'll find:

A guide file: procedure.pdf

Three folders: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 (structured in the same sequence as outlined in procedure.pdf)

Another archive: extraction.rar

Extract extraction.rar – This will provide you with the following files:

train.csv

test.csv

sample_submission.csv

data_description.txt

Copy the CSV files – Copy all three files (train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv) into Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 so that each part has all three CSV files.

⚠️ Note: I haven’t included these CSV files directly in the GitHub repository due to storage limitations.

Hope you enjoy exploring the project and find the structure easy to follow!
