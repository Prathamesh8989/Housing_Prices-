The items are already arranged in a well-ordered sequence. Please note that the outputs of most of the code have been saved. If you're running this on a local machine, make sure to either delete the saved outputs or rename the output files in the code to avoid any conflicts.

First, extract the extraction.zip file. This will provide you with the following files:

train.csv

test.csv

sample_submission.csv

data_description.txt

Next, copy the train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv files into Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3, respectively.

I haven’t done this step due to GitHub's storage limitations.

Hope you like what I’ve put together!
